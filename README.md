# lineup-smart-separators
A prototype implementation for the proof of concept for LineUp plus Time.
The following three exemplary usage scenarios are given based on the concept:

## Time-Oriented Data
Entry point: _index.html_

#### Scenario
Time scale between a ranking containing a COVID-19 dataset and a ranking with the unemployment rate. In order to use the **time column render**, change the visualization of the Hierarchy Column on the item level.

## Integration of Multiple Entity Types
Entry point: _index-genome.html_

#### Scenario
One-to-many relationships between genes and proteins. 

## Hierarchical Data
Entry point: _index-hierarchy.html_

#### Scenario
A hierarchy of diseases within a ranking containing random examples for other column types. In order to use the **hierarchy level render**, change the visualization of the Hierarchy Column on the item level.
